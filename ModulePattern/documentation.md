Module Pattern
As your application and codebase grow, it becomes increasingly important to keep your code maintainable and separated. The module pattern allows you to split up your code into smaller, reusable pieces.

Besides being able to split your code into smaller reusable pieces, modules allow you to keep certain values within your file private. Declarations within a module are scoped (encapsulated) to that module , by default. If we donâ€™t explicitly export a certain value, that value is not available outside that module. This reduces the risk of name collisions for values declared in other parts of your codebase, since the values are not available on the global scope.

With the module pattern, we can encapsulate parts of our code that should not be publicly exposed. This prevents accidental name collision and global scope pollution, which makes working with multiple dependencies and namespaces less risky.
