A singleton pattern, it is, at its core, a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. Usually, the goal is to manage global application state. Some examples I’ve seen or written myself include using a singleton as the source of config settings for a web app, on the client side for anything initiated with an API key (you usually don’t want to risk sending multiple analytics tracking calls, for example), and to store data in memory in a client-side web application (e.g. stores in Flux).
